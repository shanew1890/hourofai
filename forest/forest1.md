**The Manta Ray**
![The Manta Ray](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjwines/hourofai/master/assets/UUVMantaRay.png)
A critical intel package has slipped into enemy hands, but upon delivery, it was scattered across the ocean floor. Before the data gets back into the enemy‚Äôs hands, your mission is to pilot a recon drone across hostile waters, recover the scattered data shards, and upload them back to the ship. Once all 15 data shards are collected, the game is over and you can leave enemy waters.

You‚Äôll build a **UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle/Drone)** like the one above in this mission and:
- **Collect data** pods underwater
- **Surface** at the ship to **upload** and increase your score
- Avoid the **sonar the buoy** that can steal the data
- Use a **coded AI advisor** that will suggest "Collect / Upload / Avoid" using simple rules you can **tune**

```template
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
```

Ready to launch?

## {2. Set the Scene}
**üåä Welcome to the Ocean**

The ship is getting ready to arrive and launch the drone into the water to collect the scattered data before it gets into enemy hands.

Let's get the code in there to make that happen!

~hint What's a sprite? üí°


---


In Arcade, each character or image that does something is called a **SPRITE**.
Sprites have properties that you can use and change ‚Äî things like scale, position, and lifespan are all properties of sprites.
Our ocean and drone are actually sprites, too.

**Create Your Drone Sprite**
- :paper plane: From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` category, grab <br/>

```block
let myDrone = sprites.create(img`
    ....................
    ....................
    ....................
    ....................
    .........cf.........
    .........ff.........
    .........ccf........
    ...fff.ffffffff.....

    ......ff...fc.......
    ...........ff.......
    ....................

    ....................
    ....................
    ....................
    ....................
    `, SpriteKind.Player)
// @highlight
myDrone.setPosition(80,80)
```

Set your drone's **x** position to **80** and <br/>
**y** position to **80**.

You can always change these numbers to what ever you like.
