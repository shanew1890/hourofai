# Silent Seas- UUV Ops
### @explicitHints true

## Welcome @showdialog
You‚Äôll build a **UUV (underwater drone)** mission:
- **Collect data** pods underwater
- **Surface** at a buoy to **upload** (score!)
- **Recharge** at a dock
- Avoid **sonar buoys**
- A **coded AI advisor** will suggest "Collect / Surface / Recharge" using simple rules you can **tune**
Ready to launch?

## {2. Set the Scene}
**üåä Welcome to the Ocean**
Notice there is some code that has already been added to your program. 


~hint What's a sprite? üí°

---

In Arcade, each character or image that does something is called a **SPRITE**.
Sprites have properties that you can use and change ‚Äî things like scale, position, and lifespan are all properties of sprites.
Our ocean and drone are actually sprites, too.

**Want a new background or drone?**

- :paper sprite: From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` category, grab another <br/>
```block
let mySprite = sprites.create(img`

## {5. Try It}

- :binoculars: Look at your project in the game window!


Your sprite should move around the ocean as you move the joypad.

_üí° You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard!_


![Find the game window.](/static/skillmap/forest/game.png "The game window is in the lower corner.")

## {6. Follow with Camera}

**üòÆ Ack!**<br/>
Your drone glides off-screen if you go too far.
